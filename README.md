# Database-test
Can fill and time select and export functions of databases

It's a one-time-use script. That's why it's not polished at all.

- Use `fill.php` to create dummy data.
- Use `test_select.php` to test selecting.
- Use `test_export.php` to test exporting.

Constants can be changed with whatever you environment variables are.
